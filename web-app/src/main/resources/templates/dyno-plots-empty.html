            </div>

            <div class="panel-body">
                With Road Dyno, you can create accurate dyno graphs based on data taken by ECU or GPS logs.
                In order to achieve that, you need to log a few key parameters while making wide open throttle runs in one gear.

            <div class="panel-body">
                For the time being, supported log formats are:
                <ul>
                    <li>Megasquirt (.msl) logs</li>
                    <li>Apexi PFC / Datalogit (.txt) logs</li>
                    <li>VBox (.vbo) logs (drfitbox .dbn files can be converted to .vbo files with Driftbox tools [open and save as .vbo])</li>

                <p>For GPS logs no special settings are required, just make sure you are logging with at least 5hz refresh rate.</p>
                <p>For ECU logs make sure that the following data are logged:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Time</strong></li>

                <h4>Select a suitable/flat road or track</h4>

                <p>
                    <strong>First and foremost, make sure you drive safely!</strong>
                    Try to do all runs on a flat road and preferably always start the runs in the same spot so that
                    subsequent runs can be comparable. If you get unexpectedly low or high numbers, try running in both directions on the same stretch because
                    some
                    roadways can be deceiving and may not actually be level.
                </p>

                <h4>Making the dyno run</h4>

                <p>
                    Start by rolling the vehicle at about 2000 RPM in a gear like second or third where you are able to hold full throttle all the way to
                    redline
                    safely/legally.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Then smoothly go to full throttle(WOT) quickly but without "slamming" the throttle.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Continue the WOT run until you reach redline or whatever engine speed you choose and then left the throttle.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Lift the throttle first and then press the clutch (pressing the clutch at the same time as lifting the throttle can cause the engine to
                    "wind up", causing a spike at the end of the dyno graph. For automatics that do not have manual control, you may be forced to do the dyno
                    run
                    in first gear unless you can start the run in second above where the car would normally downshift to first.
                    Avoid first gear, or any gear that will cause wheelspin, because false readings will be logged and the graph won't be accurate.
